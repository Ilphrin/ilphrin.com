      <h2>EP7</h2>
      <p>In the heart of Paris Rive Gauche, the EP7 is a cultural café and multimedia equipment communicating for the neighbourhood and especially proposed to artists demonstrating the quality and vitality of digital creation.
      <br />
      I worked for EP7 as a Freelance, and my mission was to create a Wordpress child theme, from Avada's theme. The purpose was to re-design the page of articles, and some part of the homepage. This was an interesting experience as I had to handle the reltionship with a client all by myself, and learn technologies I didn't knew well.
