      <h2>My name is Kevin Pellet (aka Ilphrin, that's my favorite name)</h2>
      <p>I started learning programming
        since I was a kid, and love Web development. I also like to work on
        UX/UI design and talk about privacy on the Internet. 
        <br />
        Oh, and in everyday life you can get my attention with sushi,
        music, or video games. I am also a Mozillian since a few years.</p>

      <p>But I like other things too! Just not as much</p>

    <ul class="features">
      <li class="icon fa-laptop">
        <h3>Open Source</h3>
        <p>I hope for a future where everyone would be able to trust technology. A future where the Internet of Things would not betray our privacy and security. And I beleive this can only be achieved through Open-Source softwares</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-code">
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Some hate it, some love it. I am from the second side. JavaScript is an awesome language, but it is misunderstood by those who use it the wrong way. Though it is thanks to it we have cross-plateform/devices awesome app!</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-firefox">
        <h3>Mozilla</h3>
        <p>I am a volunteer since a few years now. I believe in the work of Mozilla, it gives us a free (as in freedom) and trusty open-source Web and its awesome Firefox browser</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-street-view">
        <h3>UX Design</h3>
        <p>I never really worked as a UX Designer, but learned a lot about it (books, online courses, internships, etc.), and I have this strong conviction that UX Design is where I will have the better impact in the world, more than if I only worked as Web developper</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-camera">
        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I bought a camera to have fun. And know I can't have a month or a week without taking some photos. Nature, architecture, landscape, etc.. I like everything!</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-paint-brush">
        <h3>Painting</h3>
        <p>I felt in love with Warhammer 40K a long time ago, but only with painting figurines. Now I paint on any kind of figurines, and this is soooooo relaxing. It also helped me working on my focus and concentration skills</p>
      </li>
      <li class="icon fa-headphones">
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Megadeth more than Ketty Perry. Dragon Force more than Snoop Dogg. Dissection reaaaaallly more than Rebecca Black. Vocaloid more than Shakira. Well, I am more Metal, Nightcore, and some kind of Electro in the end</p>
