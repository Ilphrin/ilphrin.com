  <h1>Presentation</h1>
  <p>
    I am on several translation websites looking for offers from agencies. I prefer to focus on projects about IT, sciences (like math, physics, etc...), and news. My rates per hour are to be discussed depending on the kind of the project: its size, how much time I have to finish it, and if the subject is interesting. Sometimes I work with Lisa Bonheme who is a freelancer too and a schoolmate. By the way, I am doing an IT school (at Epitech Lyon), so translation is more an hobby and a passion for the English language than a full-time work for me.
